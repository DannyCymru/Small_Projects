## Synopsis

Code example of how to use the laser emitter for the Arduino. Simply download the .ino file and upload it to the arduino to turn the laser emitter on and off.

## Pre-requisites

Pre-requisistes needed to run the example or to use this specific component(s)

### Hardware

#### Laser Emitter

For this one we will need a laser emitter, the one I used for this examples was a Keyes Laser Emitter.
