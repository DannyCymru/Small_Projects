## Synopsis

Code example of how to use a keyes full colour smb sensor for the Arduino.

## Pre-requisites

Pre-requisistes needed to run the example or to use this specific component(s)

### Hardware

#### Full colour SMB

The main thing you will need is the SMB full colour LED. Be careful witht his part is the light it creates can be exceedingly bright, try not to look directly into it.

The below resistors are only needed to prevent burnout of the part.
#### 330 OHM Resistor X2

## Diagram

The below diagram is how I configured it so that I could use both, utilising my lack of a bigger bread board. This set up, while it could be improved on will work. It will allow you to power the LCD and DHT11 module as well as post the DHT data to the LCD.
