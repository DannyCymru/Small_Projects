## Synopsis

The provided code in this repositoty is apart of an overall project I am conducting under the guidance of Elaine Haigh to look into, create resources and produce code to use the sensors from this pack.

## Pre-requisites

To use any code in this repository you will need a few different pieces of hardware/software.
### Hardware

#### 37 in 1 pack

This pack contains all the sensors that will be used for the very basics of the overall project. I may decide to go more in depth and add extra components and provide code for these however I will disclose exactly what hardware/components I am adding and using.

#### Arduino

For this you will also need an ardinuo and all read me files from here out will assume you have all the hardware and software disclosed here, and other components such as breadboard and jumper wires to correctly wire and connect the sensor.

You can  use any arduino however the libary used at the time of writing is untested with anything about the uno board.

You may buy an arduino from these retailers:

[Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Arduino-A000066-ATMEGA328-Microcontroller-Board/dp/B008GRTSV6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1523710890&sr=8-4&keywords=arduino+board&dpID=51-rsyPvHOL&preST=_SX300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)

[Arduino Authorised Distributors](https://store.arduino.cc/distributors)

##Software

####Arduino IDE

The arduino IDE is necessary to open the .ino files as well to upload the code to your arduino product. [You may find it here.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
