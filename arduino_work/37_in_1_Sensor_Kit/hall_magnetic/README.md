## Synopsis

Very simple of example of how to connect and use the keyes joystick part for the arduino. 

## Pre-requisites

Pre-requisistes needed to run the example or to use this specific component(s)

### Hardware

#### Keyes Hall Magnetic Sensor

The only explicit kit of hardware you need with the arduino is the keyes hall magnetic sensor. This sensor isn't exactly the most interesting. Its only good for a very binary answer of if its sensing something or not.

## Diagram

The below diagram is a very basic one, I hooked all the wires directly to the stick as to not damage the part or bending any of the pins.
