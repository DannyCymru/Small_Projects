## Synopsis

Code example of how to use a DHT11 sensor for the Arduino. Simply download the DHT11.ino file and upload it to the arduino to get temperature and humidity readings from the area.

## Pre-requisites

Pre-requisistes needed to run the example or to use this specific component(s)

### Hardware

#### DHT11

The main thing you will need is this. A DHT11 sensor. This sensor, otherwise known as an temperature and humidity sensor. The provided library will only work with this type of sensor.

## Library

To create the code example I used a library called DHTLib. I have provided a zip file of this library in the subdirectory. Incase it is out of date or new functions have been added you can download a copy from the original author [here](https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/DHTlib)
