## Synopsis

Code example of how to use a DHT11 sensor for the Arduino. Simply download the DHT11.ino file and upload it to the arduino to get temperature and humidity readings from the area.

## Pre-requisites

To use this code there are a few prereuisites or provided library you will need a few different pieces of software and hardware

### Hardware

#### DHT11

The main thing you will need is this. A DHT11 sensor. This sensor, otherwise known as an temperature and humidity sensor. The provided library will only work with this type of sensor.

#### Arduino

For this you will also need an ardinuo, and other components such as breadboard and jumper wires to correctly wire and connect the sensor.

##Library

To create the code example I used a library called DHTLib. I have provided a zip file of this library in the subdirectory. Incase it is out of date or new functions have been added you can download a copy from the original author [here](https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/DHTlib)
