Control Systems Assignment
==========================

For my assignment in control systems I had to produce a control system using a micro-controller, two sensors for input and one output to achieve the distinction. This project reads the temperature of the room with one sensor and if it also detects movement, utilising the motion PIR sensor it outputs using a buzzer. This directory contains an arduino .ino file as well as a c file with the exact code used for refrence.
