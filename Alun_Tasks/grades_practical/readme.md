Grades Practical
================

This folder houses the small in class practical that my teacher set me.The brief given for this task was as follows :

Brief
-----

"You need to design and create a program that asks the user for their results in all of their first year units. You can obtain a pass, merit, distinction, or fail.

Once you have the results, you can then work out the estimated grade for the year.
For a pass, you should add 70 points, a merit is 80 points and a distinction is 90 points. Add up the results of the first year, multiply by two and then use the table below to work out the estimated end of course grade.
If the user has even one fail, then they fail the course.
You program should have plenty of if statements in it.

Design is important. You should try and plan this out on paper in a flow chart or a list of instructions before you write it in code. The design will be worth a pass mark."

The above brief was accompanied by a small table of values with there corresponding grade value.

Version
-------

* Where is Version one? Version one which, I do believe was in the repo originally was a very barebones piece of software that was not complete. I can't check the original as I removed it but as I recall it was semi functional. The software compiled but it was not programmed to meet the required functionality that the brief outlined.

To Do
-----

* Fix it so that the user does not need to specifically put in a character for every single unit. Make it so that the program asks how many units you passed, merited or achieved a distinction in.
