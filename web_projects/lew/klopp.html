			Does Robert Lewandowski see himself as complete? are there no weak elements in his game? "Whenever you think something is good, you've lost the chance to make it better,"he tells us. In his first season with Dortmund, his finishing let him down so often that people began to wonder how he'd become to best scorer in Poland. Part of the reason might have been that Dortmund coach Juren Klopp, who had spent 3.6 Million pounds on him after protracted and complicated nogotiations with Lech Pozan, decided to play him out of position.
