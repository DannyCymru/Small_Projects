This small website was sort of collaborative. My friend created it and he asked me to take a look at it. What I did was I cleaned up all of his html as it was quite atrocious, fixed some errors with the html and css (nav bar not extending across the whole page and <nav> tags not being used) that I noticed on the site and I had a little go at trying to make the design more responsive.
