        Robert Lewandowski hesitates. It's not soething that he does often. On the pitch, one of his greatest yet overlooked qualities is the ability to instatnly make the right decision. He is seemingly never has to ask himself weather to shoot or to pass, go for placement or power, lob or drive. He instinctively knows what to do. He'll then exectute to perfection- but that's another quality and another story. 

        Off the pitch, he's honed a very ffective interview technique in recent years. When you ask him a question, he immediately launches into a reply that can be quite exhaustive.
