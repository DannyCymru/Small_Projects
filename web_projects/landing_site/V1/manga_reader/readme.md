Manga Reader
============

This is a little website I am currently working on. I have quite a few comics on my server so I decided to make a very simple manga/comic reader using PHP and Javascript, which I had avoided mostly in my other web projects.

To Do List
==========

-[x] Completed Task -[ ] Incomplete Task


-[ ] Work on the layout more and add left and right buttons to switch comic pages. 

-[X] Add an event listener so that you don't need to click on the button to switch the page.

-[ ] Use PHP to compress the images further to allow quicker loading speeds between switching comic pages

-[ ] Look into preloading and/or caching techniques to increase loading speeds.

-[x] Use PHP to make it more dynamic.

-[ ] Find/create a favicon (Because who doesn't like a nice little favicon in their browser tab?!!)

-[ ] Create a manga/comic template so that I can have a nice image when you load a comic chapter.

-[ ] Create an indivudal mange/comic page, give a brief outline of the series and list all the volumes.

-[ ] Create a page that lists all comics/manga available to read.

-[ ] Create an admin panel to add more comics with in the future.

-[ ] Create a member system

-[ ] Create a function to increase image size on click
